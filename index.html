                        <li class="listStyleNone" style="font-size:20px; margin-top: 10px;">My first co-op semester I worked for PCMS Datafit as a QA intern during the spring semester of 2018. I worked with multiple retail systems, testing the software before it was released to the customer. While working as a QA intern I received technical training on how to test software as well as how to report defects using Jira. I also had the opportunity to learn a great deal about Agile and how PCMS implemented/modified it to fit their own needs. One important non-technical skill I learned was how to work in large team. Prior to working for PCMS, I never had any experience working in a team larger than four people. Learning how to communicate with everyone as well as learning how to communicate with different roles within a large group is a skill I continue to use and refine.</li>
                        <li class="listStyleNone" style="font-size:20px; margin-top: 25px;">During my second co-op I transitioned from a QA intern to a Dev intern at PCMS Datafit. I had the opportunity to learn about PCMS’s automated testing system Auto Vera (AV). I was tasked with writing, updating, and maintaining these automation test scripts unique to the clients our team was working with. I also was tasked with a project in which I used the Jenkin’s API to kick off and verify build statuses of jobs that were sent to my program via XML. During this co-op rotation I learned how to read business ready documents (BRDs). It’s important to have the ability to read these BRDs as both a QA and as a Developer because they contain information on how customers want new features or changes to be implemented.</li>

While working it's my goal to continue to learn and develop my skills in the top programming languages, not just the one or two I’d use in my career. I’d also like to learn more about Dev Ops and possibly pursue that as well.</li>

Users can create their own profile where they can enter their budget then their expenses. Butter-Budget has several different expense categories to choose from and displays a user-friendly bar graph to visually display how much they’re spending and how much is left to spend/save. A user’s information is stored within the browser's database, similar to cookies. Butter-Budget was created using three different programming languages, Haskell, Prolog, and JS, that were part of three different programming paradigms.</p>

Users can play the game using words randomly pulled from the provided dictionary, or they can play the game using words they input themselves. Players select letters by clicking on them. If the letters are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and match a word in the word bank, then it is highlighted green and the word is crossed off.
